# Correlation Vector

## Background

**Correlation Vector** (a.k.a. **cV**) is a format and protocol standard for tracing and correlation of events through a distributed system based on a light weight vector clock.
The standard is widely used internally at Microsoft for first party applications and services and supported across multiple logging libraries and platforms (Services, Clients - Native, Managed, Js, iOS, Android etc). The standard powers a variety of different data processing needs ranging from distributed tracing & debugging to system and business intelligence, in various business organizations.

For more on the correlation vector specification and the scenarios it supports, please refer to the [specification](https://github.com/Microsoft/CorrelationVector) repo.
